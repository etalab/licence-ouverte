# OPEN LICENSE 2.0/LICENCE OUVERTE 2.0

## “Reuse” of the “Information” covered by this license

The “Grantor” grants the “Reuser” the free, non-exclusive right to “Reuse” the “Information” subject of this license, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, worldwide and for an unlimited period, in accordance with the conditions stated below.

**The “Reuser” is free to reuse the “Information”:**

-   To reproduce it, copy it.
-   To adapt, modify, retrieve and transform it in order to create “derived information”, products and services.
-   To share, disseminate, redistribute, publish and transmit it.
-   To exploit it for commercial purposes, e.g., by combining it with other information, or by including it in his/her own product or application.

**Subject to:**

-   An acknowledgement of the authorship of the “Information”: its source (at least, the name of the “Grantor”) and the date of the most recent update of the reused “Information”. Specifically, the “Reuser” may satisfy this condition by pointing, via a hypertext link, to the source of “the Information” and so supplying an actual acknowledgement of its authorship.

**For example:**

> “Ministry of xxx—Original data downloaded from `http://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/xxx/`, updated on 14 February 2017”.

This acknowledgement of authorship does not confer any official status on the “Reuse” of the “Information”, and must not suggest any sort of recognition or endorsement on the part of the “Grantor”, or any other public entity, of the “Reuser” or of their “Reuse”.

## Personal data

The “Information” made available may contain “Personal data” that may be subject to “Reuse”. If this is the case, the “Grantor” informs the “Reuser” about its existence. The “Information” may be freely reused, within the rights granted by this license, subject to compliance with the legal framework relating to personal data protection.

## Intellectual property rights

It is guaranteed to The “Reuser” that potential “Intellectual property rights” held by third parties or by the “Grantor” on “Information” do not interfere with the rights granted by this license.

When the “Grantor” holds transferable “Intellectual property rights” on the “Information”, he/she assigns these to the “Reuser” on a non-exclusive basis, free of charge, worldwide, for the entire duration of the “Intellectual property rights”, and the “Reuser” is free to use the “Information” for any purpose that complies with the rights and conditions defined in this license.

## Liability

The “Information” is made available as it is produced or received by the “Grantor”, without any other express or tacit guarantee than those set out in this license. The “Grantor” does not guarantee the absence of errors or inaccuracies in the “Information”, nor a continuous supply of the “Information”. He/she cannot be held responsible for any loss, prejudice or damage of any kind caused to third parties as a result of the “Reuse”.

The “Reuser” is solely responsible for the “Reuse” of the “Information”. This “Reuse” must not mislead third parties as to the contents of the “Information”, its source or its date of update.

## Applicable legislation

This license is governed by French law.

## About this license

This license is intended to be used by administrations for the reuse of their public information. It can also be used by any individual wishing to supply “Information” under the conditions defined in this license.

France has a comprehensive legal framework aiming at the spontaneous dissemination by the administrations of their public information in order to ensure the widest possible reuse of this information.

The right to “Reuse” the administrations’ “Information” is governed by the code des relations entre le public et l’administration  (CRPA).

This license facilitates the unrestricted and free of charge reuse of public information and is one of the licenses which can be used by the administration pursuant to the decree issued under article L. 323-2 of the CRPA.
